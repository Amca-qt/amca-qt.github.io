## Coding Projects

As a coder, I enjoy building tools and websites that solve real-world problems. One of my recent projects includes a **Python calculator**, and I’m currently working on enhancing my GitHub Pages, where I’ve started sharing my CTF write-ups. Also my Upcoming Projects to make Online Games.

## Hobbies and Project

Outside of coding and CTFs, I’m a curious learner and enjoy diving into new tech trends. Whether it's exploring new programming languages or diving into the latest cybersecurity threats, I'm always eager to learn more.
